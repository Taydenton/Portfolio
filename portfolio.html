      <p class="intro-content">SplendidSpace is a web and mobile application that allows users to easily create written notes, save images and links and share content with friends and colleagues. SplendidSpace enhances the sharing aspect of cloud storage, allowing users to create
        teams to quickly build and share products. SplendidSpace makes organization and collaboration simple and fun. For this project, I took on the design from start to finish. I utilized Sketch for most of the work, including wireframes and in conjunction
        with Invision for my final clickable prototype.</p><br><br>

      <h2 class="intro-content">THE PROBLEM</h2><br>
      <p class="intro-content">There are various products on the market that promise to boost our productivity and make us more efficient. Google Drive and OneNote for example, each provide note taking and sharing services that while advertising convenience and productivity,
        often fall short for users, lacking the consistency and collaboration technology that is often desired. For this particular project, the sharing aspect was an important feature to include, alongside creating and organizing content.</p><br>
      <h2 class="intro-content">THE SOLUTION</h2><br>
      <p class="intro-content">SplendidSpace is a working solution to common cloud storage frustrations. SplendidSpace is a web and mobile application that allows users to easily create written notes, save images and links and share this content with friends and colleagues. SplendidSpace
        also enhances the sharing aspect of cloud storage, by allowing users to create teams to quickly build and share products. SplendidSpace makes organization and collaboration simple and fun.</p>

      <p class="other-guys-text">There are plenty of competitors currently in the cloud storage market. I researched their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to determine how SplendidSpace could provide the most value to users. Every application has it’s pros and
        cons. For example, while Dropbox is a popular tool on the market to save and share content, users tend to be most frustrated that Dropbox has yet to completely nail the collaboration aspect of the product. Google Drive’s real time collaboration
        makes it ideal for group projects, but it can get a bit cluttered with all of the apps and types of projects that can be created. Finally, Pintrest has its own corner of the market as it is a unique product primarily used “just for fun” and less
        for work or school purposes. I learned through this analysis of major competitors what I wanted to focus upon for my own app - a simple product that is dedicated to collaboration, and while professional, has a youthful and energetic vibe that
        differs from the rest of the market.

          my clickable prototype, where I was able to view 3 additional people use the product. This last test helped me to make some last minute changes to the design. For example, I decided to do away with the “settings” icon, as most users were accustomed

        <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2><br />
      </header>
      <p class="learning-text">Using my research, I created a final product that helps meet the needs of the client and the end user. SplendidSpace is a simple tool, and provides the user the ability to better collaborate on mobile and desktop devices - creating a seamless experience
        when working on projects with colleagues. Those that used the app appreciated the simple design, and were able to click through easily when asked to complete certain tasks.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p class="learning-text">As with any project, I inevitably experienced some challenges along the way. This was my first time ever creating an app. It was amazing and quite insightful to understand the amount of time and energy that it takes to create each page and to design
        a flow that is cohesive and makes sense to the user. It took what seemed like an eternity to create my original wireframes! If I had additional time, or more freedom in the project, I would have liked to create a product that is more unique -
        an idea that I had was something similar to “Hootsuite” but for cloud storage apps. I learned that while the mind of a designer may have a multitude of ideas of what could be the “best” design or formatting for an application, the stakeholders
        and users are the most important. It is vital to do research and test multiple times in order to really hone in on the perspective of the end user, and they may be different than your own, as well as check back on your original objectives as to
        not lose sight of what your client desires in the end product.
