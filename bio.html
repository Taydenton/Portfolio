  <section class="biography">
    <h1 class="intro">Hi, I'm Taylor,</h1><br>
    <p>Design has always been a part of my life. My dad is a graphic designer and app developer and my mom is an interior designer. As a kid I was obssessed with drawing and coloring.
    </p><br>

    <br>
    <p>As I grew older, my intention in college was to find a career within the nonprofit sector in public or global health - I wanted to help others. As most of us can likely understand, what we envision our lives looking like at 20 can vastly change over
      time, and due to the various twists and turns of life, I have worked in insurance and SaaS. While my journey in both industries have been worthwhile pursuits, a career in UX design feels like I’m <strong>going back to my “roots”</strong>.
    </p><br>

    <br>
    <p>What I appreciate about design is that it is a <strong>pervasive component of the human experience</strong> - involved in our day to day lives while we often never take a moment to consider it’s impact. While good design appears effortless and often goes unnoticed
      in it’s perfection, bad design can present itself as an unwanted inconvenience. My dream is that the energy I put into my work in design can help create technologies that allow people to solve problems, inform others or stay better connected. I
      want to work on projects that can help others, whether that is simply boosting the convenience of everyday life, or providing a voice to non-profit organizations. <strong>When it comes to design, the possibilities are endless.</strong></p>
